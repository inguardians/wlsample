# wlsample

Microsoft included a tool called "wlsample.exe" with the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows Server 2008. This program allows a penetration tester to connect to a network without generating a saved profile. Microsoft has released source code for this tool and cleared it for public redistribution.

Josh Wright references Wlsample in section 3.3 of his "Vista Wireless Power Tools for the Penetration Tester" paper.
